# 1.1 集合的概念 The Concept of a Set

## 基础概念 Basic Concept

### 定义 Definition

- **元素**：对于研究对象，称之为元素．元素就是对象，有点像面向对象中的对象．
  - 例如：数字 1，2，3 都可以看作是元素．
- **集合**：若干个元素组成的整体，称之为集合．集合包含若干个元素．
  - 例如：1，2，3，这三个数字可以组成一个集合．这三个数字就是包含于集合中的元素．

A set is a **well-defined** collection of distinct objects, known as elements, that we want to study as a specific group in mathematics.

- **Element**: An object to be studied in mathematics, which can be a number, a variable, an expression, etc. For example, the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are elements, which may or may not belong to a specific set.
- **Set**: A well-defined collection of elements, which can be none, single, or multiple. A set containing zero elements is called an empty set, and a set containing one element is called a singleton set. For example, the numbers "1", "2", and "3" can form a set $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$, consisting of these three elements.

### 集合的三大特性 Three Properties of Sets

1. 确定性：集合元素具有确定性．集合中的元素是唯一确定的．对于描述不够准确的元素所组成的不能叫作集合．
   - 例如：“身材较高的同学”描述不够准确，不符合集合的确定性，所以就不能称之为集合；而“身高大于 1.8 米的同学”描述有一个明确的标准，符合集合的确定性，所以就能够称之为集合．
2. 互异性：集合元素具有互异性．集合中的元素互不相同．含有重复元素的不能叫做集合．
   - 例如： $\{ 1, 1, 2, 3 \}$ 中含有两个相同的元素“1”，不符合集合的互异性，所以就不能称之为集合； $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ 中没有相同的元素，符合集合的互异性，所以就能够称之为集合．
3. 无序性：集合元素具有无序性．集合中的元素没有顺序．只要是由相同的元素组成的集合就是相等的集合．
   - 例如： $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}=\{ 1, 3, 2 \}=\{ 3, 2, 1 \}$ ，三个集合都是由 1，2，3 三个元素组成的，所以是相等的集合．只要构成两个集合的元素是一样的，就可以称两个集合相等．

A set is a well-defined collection of distinct elements, which are unordered. ~~A set has three properties: determinism, distinctness, and disorder.~~

1. The elements of a set are **well-defined**.
   - A *great* number cannot be an element of a set. A number *greater than 1* can be an element of a set.
1. The elements of a set are **distinct**.
   - Therefore, we get $\{ a, b, c, b \} = \{ a, b, c \}$. However, in general, we do not describe a set using a form such as $\{ a, b, c, b \}$ containing duplicate elements, as this is considered non-standard. In other words, if such a non-standard form results from an inference, that form must be transformed into the correct form such as $\{ a, b, c \}$ with distinct elements.
   - If a set $\{ a, b, c \}$ exists, then we get $a \ne b$, $b \ne c$, and $a \ne c$, which means that $a$, $b$, and $c$, all of the elements of the set, are distinct.
1. The elements of a set are **unordered**.
   - Therefore, we get $\{ a, b, c \} = \{ a,\ c,\ b \} = \{ c, b, a \}$. 

### Notation for Sets and Elements

- **Set**: Sets are typically denoted by uppercase Latin letters: $A, B, C, \dots, X, Y, Z$.
- **Element**: Elements are typically denoted by lowercase Latin letters: $a, b, c, \dots, x, y, z$.

### Relationship of Sets and Elements

- **Belonging to**: If $a$ is an element of a set $A$, then $a$ *belongs to* $A$, written as $a \in A$. For example, given $a = 5, A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \}$, we can say that $a \in A$.
- **Not belonging to**: If $a$ is not an element of a set $A$, then $a$ does not belong to $A$, written as $a \notin A$. For example, given $a = 5, A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}$,  we can say that $a \notin A$.

### Representation of Sets

There are several methods to describe a set, such as natural language, common number sets, roster notation, and set-builder notation.

1. Natural Language: We can describe a set using words from everyday language. For example, "integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 5" defines the set $\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \}$.
2. **Common Number Sets**: We use specified uppercase letters to represent certain numbers. 
    - $\mathbb{N}$ Natural Numbers (Non-negative Integers): $\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}$. The set of positive integers and 0.
    - $\mathbb{N^*} \text{ or } \mathbb{N_+}$ Positive Integers: $\mathbb{N^*} \text{ or } \mathbb{N_+} = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots \}$. The set of positive integers, excluding 0.
    - $\mathbb{Z}$ Integers: $\mathbb{Z} = \{ \dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots \}$. The set of integers, including the positive integers, the negative integers, and 0.
    - $\mathbb{Q}$ Rational Numbers: $\mathbb{Q} = \left\{ \frac{p}{q} \mid p \in \mathbb{Z}, q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \ne 0 \right\}$. The set of numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers.
    - $\mathbb{R}$ Real Numbers: $\mathbb{R}$. The set of numbers including the rational numbers and irrational numbers.
3. **Roster Notation**: We can describe a set using a pair of braces including all the elements of the set. For example, $\{ a, b, c \}$.
4. **Set-Builder Notation**: In general, for a set $A$ whose elements belong to a set $B$ and have the property $P(x)$ as a logical condition, we can represent this set as $$A = \{ x \in B \mid P(x) \} \text{.}$$
    - We can omit the part $x \in B$ if the context is clear.
    - In this notation, the vertical bar "|" is read as "such that."
    - For example, a set of all even numbers can be represented as $$\{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x = 2k, k \in \mathbb{Z} \} \text{.}$$
